## Why does a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server matter?
Web behemoths like Facebook and Google are moving at a breakneck speed to make life better for front-end developers. By creating new technologies like React, these companies free developers to focus on the business logic of their new applications and services while abstracting away the back-end issues that have historically slowed developers. Facebook rightly gets credit for its front-end work with open source React, but it may deserve even more credit for open sourcing GraphQL, an emerging query language. In a new cloud native world of microservices, the number of endpoint APIs increases exponentially, which is proving a huge challenge for traditional SQL technologies. GraphQL, however, can communicate across microservices and operate almost as a gateway to all of your services â€” a unifying source that provides a holistic view of all your systems.
